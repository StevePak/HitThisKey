Hit This Key!
A Typing Game

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:

This is a typing game where letters will pop up and the user must type in the 
letters that appear on the screen. This is modeled in C# after the project in
Head First C# by Andrew Stellman & Jennifer Greene. "Hit This Key" will keep 
track of all your hits and misses, as well as increasing the difficulty(speed)
as you progress. The game will end when there are 7 untyped letters on the 
screen.

HOW TO USE:
You will need Microsoft Visual Studio, or any other program that runs Windows 
Forms. From there, download all the files in the project folder, and then run
the program.
